	<p>I just purchased the new Apple AirPods Max on Saturday. Over the coming week I will be testing the headphones and offering my unbiased (but <i>totally</i> biased) opinion. Keep tuned as I update you throughout the week. </p><br>
	<h2>Tuesday, May 26, 2021</h2>
	<p>Today is the day that I fell in love with these headphones. I've had them for 4 days now, but today was the first day where I tried to wear the headphones as much as possible. I wore them while working, while following this CSS tutorial, and while simply listening to music. <br><br>
	What I've discovered over the last few days: 1) The noise cancelling is far better than my Bose headphones. 2) They don't hurt my ear - I was concerned the weight and pressure would make my ears hurt, but they don't. 3) I tested the transparency mode and it's outstanding! Truly a marvel compared to my other headphones.</p><br>
